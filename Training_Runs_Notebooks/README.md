A directory containing all of the Google Colab training runs (each visually testing a model architecture change) conducted over the project.

The progression of the datasets is:

1. MNIST
2. MNIST Fashion
3. CelebA

Each run has a version number - later version indicates a later (and hopefully improved) run.
