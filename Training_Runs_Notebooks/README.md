A directory containing all of the Google Colab training runs (each visually testing a model architecture change) conducted over the project.

The progression of the datasets is:

1. MNIST - generating monochromatic images of handwritten digits
2. MNIST Fashion - generating monochromatic images of cartoon clothing items
3. CelebA - generating colour images of human faces

Each run has a version number - later version indicates a later (and hopefully improved) run.

Quick Reference:
The latest Run on the most challenging dataset (CelebA) can be found at CelebA_GAN_1_0_1.ipynb
