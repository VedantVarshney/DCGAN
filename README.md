# GAN Practice

A project for implementing Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and investigating the effectiveness of various heuristic and theoretically-sound additions on a variety of standard datasets (namely MNIST, MNIST Fashion and CelebA).

Note - this project is currently in-progress.

Instructions:
- See gan.py for the base model.
- View some of the latest training run notebooks in the directory 'Training_Runs_Notebooks'. Note that this directory also includes a README for further direction
